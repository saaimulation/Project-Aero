# 🏎️ Qualifying Lap — CFD  

"And here we are, lights out on the next stage of Project: Aero! The CAD lap is in the books, ST0 has rolled out of the garage, and it’s heading straight into the CFD arena. No wind tunnel, no factory-scale computers. Just me, SimScale, and a very nervous laptop fan."  

This part of the project is all about finding out if my RB19-inspired, regulation-legal, student-version-of-NX front wing can actually generate downforce… or if I’ve just built a very stylish drag machine.  

### 🎯 Goals  

- Import the geometry into SimScale and generate a clean mesh.  
- Run airflow simulations at baseline F1 speeds (~50 m/s to start).  
- Visualise pressure, velocity, and streamlines to understand behaviour.  
- See if the slot gaps and flap angles really do their job, or if I’ve engineered the world’s most expensive desk fan.  

### 🛠️ Tools  

- **SimScale** (meshing + solver + post-processing in one platform)  

---

Think of this as Q1 in qualifying: the aim isn’t to smash records yet, but to get a solid lap on the board. Once the pipeline works, we’ll push harder in Q2 and Q3 which means higher speeds, setup tweaks, and hopefully a lot more downforce.  

### 🧠 What I Expect to See  

- A clear **pressure differential** across the wing (high pressure above, low pressure below), confirming it generates downforce rather than lift.  
- **Streamlines** remaining attached through the slot gaps — if they detach too early, the wing stalls and performance drops off a cliff.  
- Evidence of **Y250 vortex structures** forming near the central section, helping control airflow downstream.  
- The **outer flaps** biasing flow outward around the tyres (like the RB19), reducing wake turbulence and drag.  
- Boundary layers that stay thin and attached, if they thicken or separate too much, I’ll know my flap angles were too aggressive.  

If I see these features, I’ll know the design philosophy was on the right track. If not… well, back to the CAD garage for ST1.  

### The start 

So we begin! Just like the start of most of the work so far, I have absolutely no idea how to use this software, but that's fine, we fail fast and try again faster!
