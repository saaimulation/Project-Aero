# Project: Aero 🏎️
Designing wings that (almost) qualify for Monaco — CAD → CFD → 3D print → Wind Tunnel  

Welcome to the BATCAVE🦇 

This repo is where I document my Formula 1-inspired aero projects.  
From sketches in NX to simulations in SimScale and 3D prints at 3 am, as well as smoke tests in a homemade wind-tunnel.

IT'S ALL HERE!

I’m still early in the journey, so you’ll (hopefully) see the quality of my work improve lap by lap.  
Grab a coffee (or duct tape) and enjoy the race ;)

## 🚦 Engineering Workflow Race

### 🏁 [Practice Lap — CAD in NX](./practice-lap-CAD) ✅ Complete
`[██████████] 100%`  
Creating the baseline front wing geometry in Siemens NX.  
The design takes inspiration from the RB19, while considering upcoming 2026 regulations.  

### 🔴 [Qualifying 1 — Red Flag](./qualifying-1) ✅ Complete
`[██████████] 100%`  
This is the first attempt of running CFD on my wing! <br>
Met with unexpected difficulties, this is a stepping stone to becoming better. 

### ♟️ [Qualifying 2 — Changing Strategy](./qualifying-2) 🔄 In Progress 
`[----------] 0%` 
After some insightful feedback from a real F1 engineer, I've started this lap with fresh tyres.   
Currently designing the 2nd iteration for my front wing!

### ♟️ [Qualifying 3 — ???](./qualifying-3) ⏳ Planned 
`[----------] 0%`
Not sure if this will be needed yet!

### 🏎️ [Sprint Lap — 3D Printing](./sprint-3D-printing) ✅ Complete
`[██████████] 100%`  
Manufacturing a half-span model of the front wing on the Bambu A1, as well as a larger version for visuals.<br>
These parts will be used for physical testing in the upgraded wind tunnel.  
*psst. There's a free F1 wing model for you inside!*

### 🌬️ [Grand Prix — Wind Tunnel Mark II](./grand-prix-wind-tunnel) 🔄 In Progress 
`[█---------] 10%`  
Testing the 3D-printed wing in a new tunnel with flow visualisation techniques.  
The key aim is to evaluate how closely the tunnel data aligns with CFD predictions.  

### 📊 [Podium Review — Analysis & Iteration](./podium-review-analysis) ⏳ Planned  
`[----------] 0%`  
Documenting the full workflow in a 5-page executive summary report.  
The report compares CFD and wind tunnel results, highlights lessons learned, and sets directions for the next design cycle.
