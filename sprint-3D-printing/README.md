# üèéÔ∏è Sprint Lap ‚Äì 3D Printing

*"Box now! Box! Box now box, for hard! Uh, STAY OUT, STAY OUT!"*

Hello again! This time we‚Äôre doing something a lot easier: 3D printing the front wing!
This should be quick, welcome to the sprint!

## üéØ Filament choice

I bought CF PLA (carbon fibre PLA filament) for the print.  
[Link to the exact one I used](https://www.amazon.co.uk/FLASHFORGE-Filament-Dimensional-Lightweight-Heat-Resistant/dp/B0DHZQ8812/ref=sr_1_7?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WuFrvd5-fzhBbLjLpIsEYK_rOOp7MpHopHjIkA7lXRj8lXz4k7e3wLJi6JaRUf8jL9lLcOEJSVRxzbGGFznK0edJv1PAF6WNp-D7-mt-smSubkE4kAx8XwDTyIZM6FurbALHPqd2gZaJbOWqmcrcK-7UvK-QfVXcW6_Fkx4LMMfJCL8XPsxfJ3YBkurMuMZ-iGxwtwl8UaPmpyfZN33lm59NaVq0fYPSCQWb5knJFWaWGaJyZxedjNXwgWZcdColCKG0K2QYZLQYN8qwF_rfk6j0yN42kdgkqkvp77bUus4.f3l7GlCDoZeJLk7zPmnToVySm3kOCLVjTsCdtgEdTnQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=carbon%2Bfibre%2Bfilament&qid=1758226459&sr=8-7&th=1).

It‚Äôs only 10% carbon fibre but at ~¬£20 it‚Äôs decent for testing.
(and good for a broke university student)

## üñ•Ô∏è Slicing setup

Opened the ST0 model in Bambu Studio. Not my first time slicing, but definitely the first time at this scale.

</p>

I cut the model into sections and placed them on separate build plates:

</p>

## üí• First failed attempt

The first section was estimated at 8 hours‚Ä¶ but not even 30 minutes in, disaster struck.
Supports failed, the print warped, and almost 400 g of filament was about to be wasted.

</p>

And honestly‚Ä¶ this meme sums it up better than words:

</p>

Lesson learned: at 30% scale, the flaps were only a few millimetres thick. Even if the print had finished, sticking the pieces together would‚Äôve been a nightmare.

## ‚úÖ New plan

I decided to split this into two separate goals:

1. A display model ‚Äî larger scale, purely for my room.  
2. A test model ‚Äî smaller, around 10‚Äì15% scale, for the wind tunnel.

Here‚Äôs the setup for the display print:

  <img src="./images/newprint.png" width="430"/>
  <img src="./images/newprint1.png" width="430"/>
</p>

Rotating the wing nose-up reduced the supports under the thin flaps and saved print time + material.

Final slicer check:

Now we wait 8 hours‚Ä¶ fingers crossed this time.

## üß± Results

Couldn‚Äôt sleep because of the whirring fans from the printer, but when it was done, it came out pretty well!

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/printed1.png" width="430"/>
  <img src="./images/printed2.png" width="430"/>
</p>

There was a lot of material used on the supports, but much less than the previous attempt because I managed to lower the infill and branch diameter.

Here is how the half-span print looks:

  <img src="./images/halfspanprint.png" width="600"/>
</p>

I realised one potential issue, a bit too late, which was the nose of the wing only being connected by a thin wall in the model:

  <img src="./images/thinconnection.png" width="600"/>
</p>

This is reflected in the 3D printed version too, but it will be fine after I join the two halves together, giving it more support.  
The edges have some imperfections, most likely due to the tiny rear fillets on the flaps, which became even smaller after scaling down.

I‚Äôm currently printing the other half of the front wing, which I can then glue together, and stick to my wall!
