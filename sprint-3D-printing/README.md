# 🏎️ Sprint Lap — 3D Printing  

"Box, box, box for hards… STAY OUT, STAY OUT!"  

Welcome back! This time we’re in the garage with something a little different: 3D printing the front wing we built in CAD. No new regs to read, no endless datum planes… just slicing, supports, and a lot of filament. Welcome to the sprint lap.

## 🧵 The filament  

First up: I grabbed some CF PLA (carbon fibre PLA) filament. Nothing crazy, just a £20 spool with 10% carbon fibre.  

Link: [Amazon — CF PLA](https://www.amazon.co.uk/FLASHFORGE-Filament-Dimensional-Lightweight-Heat-Resistant/dp/B0DHZQ8812/)  

Not aerospace-grade, but it looks the part. Decent for a broke student who wants carbon fibre vibes without remortgaging the house.

## 🖥️ Into Bambu Studio  

Loaded up the ST0 model into Bambu Studio. This wasn’t my first time slicing, but it was the first time I tried something *big*.

I cut the model into parts, spread them across different build plates, and set it all up.

One section alone was estimated at 8 hours.

## 💥 First failed attempt  

Not even 30 minutes in, disaster. Supports failed, the print warped, and almost 400 g of filament was about to be wasted.

Honestly though, this meme sums it up better than words:

Lesson learned: at 30% scale the flaps were only a few millimetres thick. Even if the print had finished, gluing everything together would’ve been a nightmare.

## 🪛 Rethinking the plan  

So, instead of trying to force one massive print, I decided on two different models:  

1. **Display model** — larger wing, just to hang up or stick on a shelf.  
2. **Tunnel model** — smaller (10–15% scale) so it’ll fit inside the wind tunnel I’m building.

## ✅ The new print  

For the display version, I rotated the model so the nose faced upwards. That way, there weren’t a hundred supports hanging under the flaps. Less material, cleaner finish, faster print.

</p>  

Now it’s just a matter of waiting ~8 hours and praying it doesn’t explode mid-print. This time, I actually trusted it enough to get some sleep.

## 🏁 Wrap-up  

3D printing the wing is its own race: strategy, failures, and last-minute setup changes. The first attempt taught me that scale matters more than I thought, and the second attempt showed me how print orientation can make or break thin aero parts.  

Next step: the wind tunnel model. Once that’s printed, the CFD and experimental testing will finally meet in the middle.
